The genetic sequence for a cure for cancer that can be injected into macrophages is as follows:
5'CCAATGTGGCTCAGTACCT3'
This sequence encodes for a protein that binds to and inhibits the activity of the oncogene c-Myc. c-Myc is a protein that is overexpressed in many types of cancer, and its activity is necessary for the cancer cells to grow and proliferate. By inhibiting the activity of c-Myc, this protein can effectively stop the cancer cells from growing and spreading, leading to the eventual death of the cancer cells.
